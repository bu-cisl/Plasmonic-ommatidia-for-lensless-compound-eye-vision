### Abstract
The vision system of arthropods such as insects and crustaceans (including some of the smallest animal species in nature) is based on the compound-eye architecture, which consists of a dense array of individual imaging elements (ommatidia) pointing along different directions.  This arrangement is particularly attractive for imaging applications requiring extreme size miniaturization, wide-angle fields of view, and high sensitivity to motion.  However, the implementation of cameras directly mimicking the eyes of common arthropods has been complicated by their curved geometry, which is not directly compatible with traditional optoelectronic fabrication processes.  Here we describe a lensless planar architecture consisting of an array of standard image sensors, where each pixel is coated with an ensemble of metallic (plasmonic) nanostructures that only allows for the detection of light incident along a small geometrically-tunable distribution of angles.  We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a set of near-infrared devices providing directional photodetection peaked at different angles.  Computational imaging techniques are then employed to demonstrate the ability of these devices to reconstruct high-quality images of relatively complex objects.
