### Abstract
The vision system of arthropods such as insects and crustaceans (some of the smallest animals in nature) is based on the compound-eye architecture, which consists of a dense array of imaging elements (ommatidia) pointing along different directions.  This arrangement is particularly attractive for imaging applications requiring extreme size miniaturization and wide-angle fields of view.   However, the implementation of cameras directly mimicking the eyes of common arthropods is complicated by fabrication challenges related to their curved geometry.  Here we describe a lensless planar architecture, where each pixel of a standard image-sensor array is coated with an ensemble of metallic (plasmonic) nanostructures that only transmits light incident along a small geometrically-tunable distribution of angles.  A set of near-infrared devices providing directional photodetection peaked at different angles is designed, fabricated, and tested.  Computational imaging techniques are then employed to demonstrate the ability of these devices to reconstruct high-quality images of relatively complex objects.
